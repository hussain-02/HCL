Day 1 — Java Platform Basics + Agile/Scrum Basics
What I Learned
Java Platform
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs the bytecode. Platform-dependent (different for Windows, Mac, Linux).
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JVM + libraries needed to run Java programs.
JDK (Java Development Kit): JRE + tools (javac, java, javap) needed to develop Java programs.
JVM Architecture: Class Loader → Bytecode Verifier → Execution Engine (Interpreter + JIT Compiler).
Flow: .java file → javac compiler → .class bytecode → JVM → machine code.
Agile / Scrum
Sprint: A fixed time-box (usually 2-4 weeks) where a usable product increment is delivered.
Standup: Daily 15-min meeting — What I did, What I'll do, Blockers.
Retrospective: End-of-sprint meeting to improve process (What went well? What didn't? Action items).
User Stories: Short descriptions of a feature from the user's perspective: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."
Story Points: Relative estimate of effort (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... Fibonacci).
Definition of Done (DoD): Checklist that must pass before a story is considered complete.
Practical Work
Files
PlatformInfo.java — Prints Java version, OS name, processors, max/free heap.
How to Run
javac PlatformInfo.java
java PlatformInfo
javap -c PlatformInfo
java -verbose:class PlatformInfo
Output Expected
=== Java Platform Information ===
Java Version  : 17.0.x
OS Name       : Windows 11
Processors    : 8
Max Heap (MB) : 2048
Free Heap (MB): 245
Key Commands Explained
javac — Compiles .java to .class bytecode.
java — Runs the bytecode on JVM.
javap -c — Shows disassembled bytecode (see what the compiler generated).
java -verbose:class — Shows every class being loaded by the JVM at runtime.
